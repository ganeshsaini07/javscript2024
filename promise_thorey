// in this programme if i have gave a task , programme give a promise to complate as soon as.

//"I Promise a Result!"

// why needs promise => handle asynchronous operations

// "Producing code" is code that can take some time

// "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

// A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code

// if i want to access any file in programme ,in this case file is  not gave access directly, kernel take a responsabilty for
// access to any file in networking system. we need to kernal for access of any files in any programming lanugauge.
// for this issue very first we need to access of kernal

// promise is complete in future.

//In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future. If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, but if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed. The possible outcomes here are similar to that of promises in real life.

// promise have 3 states:
// 1. pending   => 	undefined => While the value is not yet available  // After,it transitions to one of the two states: resolved or rejected 
// 2. fullfiled  => a result value
// 3. rejected  => an error object
